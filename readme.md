# Star Trek API - Early Learning Project

A small practice project built to explore backend development with Node.js and Express.  
This project was created as part of my learning journey and focuses on understanding the basics of server-side routing and API responses.

**Link to project:** Not deployed / local development only

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Node.js, Express, CORS

This project was intentionally kept minimal to focus on learning core concepts.  
It demonstrates a simple GET route that accepts a Star Trek species name as a URL parameter (e.g., `/api/{alien-name}`) and returns the corresponding species data.

The architecture is basic and does not include a database, authentication, or frontend framework.  
This setup allowed me to focus purely on how to handle requests, return responses, and structure a minimal Express server.

## Optimizations

Since this is an early learning project, optimizations are minimal. Basic cleanup was done to keep routes readable and ensure consistent responses for valid and invalid requests.

## Future Improvements

Potential next steps could include expanding the API to support additional endpoints, improving error handling, and adding documentation for available routes. The project could also be extended with a small frontend or a database for more practice.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of Express routing and how URL parameters are used to drive API responses.  
It was an important early step in building confidence with backend development and server-side JavaScript.
